# Ex1 repository
this repository contains classes that represent Polynom, Monom, ComplexFunction,functions GUI.
there are tests also for those classes.

### ComplexFunction class 
this class rerepresents a complex function of type y=g(f1(x), f2(x)), where both f1, f2 are functions (or complex functions), 
 * y and x are real numbers and g is an operation: plus, mul, div, max, min, comp (f1(f2(x))).

### Polynom class 
This class represents a general Polynom: f(x) = a_1X^b_1 + a_2*X^b_2 ... a_n*Xb_n.

### Monom class
This class represents a simple "Monom" of shape a*x^b.

### Functions_GUI
this class contains collection of functions and got the ability to open a GUI window for drawing the functions.
